# rlbot-go Design - v1

rlbot-go is intended to provide access to Rocket League's RLBot API in Go as well as providing
standardized building blocks for creating a custom Rocket League bot in Go.

This document intends to detail the design of `rlbot-go`, including the package's responsibilities,
any deviations from existing RLBot libraries, and any context on how the package is intended to be
used by consumers.
